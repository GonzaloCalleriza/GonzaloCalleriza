### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Gonzalo
#### I am Front End Developer passionate and a professional in Emotional Intelligence
I'm a digital nomad with a strong background in Emotional Intelligence that wants to bring together technology and socioemotional skills. For this I have been learning and putting into motion various Front End projects, seeing how we can relate better through a screen, and want to take them to the next level, by working together with other points of view, creating a bigger and better impact.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JS / ReactJS / Java / Python

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on ReactJS projects (stay log in for more) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React JS (to the fullest) and Python 
- âš¡ Fun fact: slowly but surely I will create the first artificial intelligence with complex emotions (and probably the end of times)
